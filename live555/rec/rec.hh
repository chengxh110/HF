// Define a class to hold per-stream state that we maintain throughout each stream's lifetime:

class StreamClientState {
public:
  StreamClientState();
  virtual ~StreamClientState();

  void addCache(unsigned char const* data, unsigned dataSize);
  void writeFile();
  void closeFile();

public:
  MediaSubsessionIterator* iter;
  MediaSession* session;
  MediaSubsession* subsession;
  TaskToken streamTimerTask;
  double duration;
  FILE *fid;
  struct timeval lastTime;
  u_int8_t* frameCache;
  unsigned int cacheUsed;
  int last_dir_n;
};

// If you're streaming just a single stream (i.e., just from a single URL, once), then you can define and use just a single
// "StreamClientState" structure, as a global variable in your application.  However, because - in this demo application - we're
// showing how to play multiple streams, concurrently, we can't do that.  Instead, we have to have a separate "StreamClientState"
// structure for each "RTSPClient".  To do this, we subclass "RTSPClient", and add a "StreamClientState" field to the subclass:

class ourRTSPClient: public RTSPClient {
public:
  static ourRTSPClient* createNew(UsageEnvironment& env, char const* rtspURL,
				  int verbosityLevel = 0,
				  char const* applicationName = NULL,
				  portNumBits tunnelOverHTTPPortNum = 0);

protected:
  ourRTSPClient(UsageEnvironment& env, char const* rtspURL,
		int verbosityLevel, char const* applicationName, portNumBits tunnelOverHTTPPortNum);
    // called only by createNew();
  virtual ~ourRTSPClient();

public:
  StreamClientState scs;
};

// Define a data sink (a subclass of "MediaSink") to receive the data for each subsession (i.e., each audio or video 'substream').
// In practice, this might be a class (or a chain of classes) that decodes and then renders the incoming audio or video.
// Or it might be a "FileSink", for outputting the received data into a file (as is done by the "openRTSP" application).
// In this example code, however, we define a simple 'dummy' sink that receives incoming data, but does nothing with it.

class DummySink: public MediaSink {
public:
  static DummySink* createNew(UsageEnvironment& env,
			      StreamClientState& scs, // identifies the kind of data that's being received
			      char const* streamId = NULL); // identifies the stream itself (optional)

private:
  DummySink(UsageEnvironment& env, StreamClientState& scs, char const* streamId);
    // called only by "createNew()"
  virtual ~DummySink();

  static void afterGettingFrame(void* clientData, unsigned frameSize,
                                unsigned numTruncatedBytes,
				struct timeval presentationTime,
                                unsigned durationInMicroseconds);
  void afterGettingFrame(uint32_t frameSize, unsigned numTruncatedBytes,
			 struct timeval presentationTime, unsigned durationInMicroseconds);

private:
  // redefined virtual functions:
  virtual Boolean continuePlaying();

private:
  MediaSubsession& fSubsession;
  StreamClientState& fscs;
  char* fStreamId;
  char* fFileNamePrefix;
  u_int8_t* fReceiveBuffer;
  unsigned int frameCounter;  // count 264 frame
};


// Forward function definitions:

// RTSP 'response handlers':
void continueAfterDESCRIBE(RTSPClient* rtspClient, int resultCode, char* resultString);
void continueAfterSETUP(RTSPClient* rtspClient, int resultCode, char* resultString);
void continueAfterPLAY(RTSPClient* rtspClient, int resultCode, char* resultString);

// Other event handler functions:
void subsessionAfterPlaying(void* clientData); // called when a stream's subsession (e.g., audio or video substream) ends
void subsessionByeHandler(void* clientData); // called when a RTCP "BYE" is received for a subsession
void streamTimerHandler(void* clientData);
  // called at the end of a stream's expected duration (if the stream has not already signaled its end using a RTCP "BYE")

// The main streaming routine (for each "rtsp://" URL):
void openURL(UsageEnvironment& env, char const* progName, char const* rtspURL);

// Used to iterate through each stream's 'subsessions', setting up each one:
void setupNextSubsession(RTSPClient* rtspClient);

// Used to shut down and close a stream (including its "RTSPClient" object):
void shutdownStream(RTSPClient* rtspClient, int exitCode = 1);

// rec run loop
void rec_run(void);
